# Secure Deployments on Github using OIDC (OpenID Connect)

Managing secrets across multiple tools and environments can quickly become a headache. Static credentials need to be stored, secured, rotated, and audited, and each new integration adds further complexity. It's not just a security risk; it's also a maintenance burden. This is where we need to consider a modern approach to authentication that replaces static secrets with short-lived, verifiable identity tokens. 

# OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Built on top of OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol designed to enable secure and standardized verification of user identities. It allows clients to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end users through ID Tokens, which carry identity data. Widely used with federated identity providers (IdPs), OIDC is designed to work with modern APIs, making it a reliable choice for verifying identities across diverse systems.
